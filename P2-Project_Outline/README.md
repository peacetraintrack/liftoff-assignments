# **Lift-Off Recipe Tracker**

### Overview
The LRT came from a brainstorming session within our liftoff group.  Although we all had diverse interests, we all enjoy cooking -- or at least eating.  We wanted to create a recipe app that would keep the recipes in one place rather than dozens of cookbooks, recipe cards, and websites.  Our app will allow the user to save favorite recipes, introduce the user to recipes that are interesting, and offer the practicality of shopping lists, adjustable serving sizes, and use of ingredients in their pantry.

### Features
